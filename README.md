## Background & Purpose

This repository provides a **Cookiecutter template** to automate the creation of MLOps project skeletons. Its goals are to:

1. **Standardize** file and folder organization  
2. **Speed up** new project setup  
3. **Ensure** reproducibility and team collaboration  

---

## Features

- Generates a complete folder structure (`data/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `tests/`, etc.)  
- Pre-filled base files:  
  - `README.md` (with Cookiecutter variables)  
  - `.gitignore`  
  - `requirements.txt`  
- Easy to extend with:  
  - CI/CD workflows (e.g. GitHub Actions)  
  - Git hooks (`pre-commit`)  
  - Data versioning (DVC)  
  - Documentation frameworks (MkDocs, Sphinx)  

---

## Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.7  
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) installed (`pip install cookiecutter`)  
- Git (for version control and publishing)  

---

## Installing the Template

Clone this repo locally or point Cookiecutter directly at GitHub:

```bash
# Option A: Clone and use locally
git clone https://github.com/thefranckt/mlops-project-template.git
cd mlops-project-template

# Option B: Use directly from GitHub
# cookiecutter https://github.com/thefranckt/mlops-project-template.git


Generating a New Project
From the parent directory where you want your new project:

bash
Copier
Modifier
cookiecutter /path/to/mlops-project-template
Or, without cloning:

bash
Copier
Modifier
cookiecutter https://github.com/thefranckt/mlops-project-template.git
You will be prompted to enter:

project_name: the name of your new project folder (e.g. my_mlops_project)

author_name: your name or team name

python_version: target Python version (e.g. 3.10)

description: a short description of the project

After confirmation, a new directory {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/ will be created with the full structure and files in place.

Generated Project Structure
bash
Copier
Modifier
{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/           # Raw, unprocessed data
│   └── processed/     # Cleaned/processed data
├── models/            # Trained model artifacts
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
├── src/               # Python source code
│   └── __init__.py
├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
├── .gitignore         # Files and folders to ignore in Git
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt   # Base Python dependencies
Each folder is ready for your scripts, datasets, and notebooks.

Customizing the Template
To adapt this template to your needs:

Edit cookiecutter.json to add or change variables.

Add or remove folders/files under {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/.

Implement Cookiecutter hooks (pre- and post-generation scripts).

Update the contents of README.md, .gitignore, and requirements.txt to suit your standards.
CI/CD & Code Quality
You can integrate continuous integration and quality checks:

Example: GitHub Actions Workflow
Create .github/workflows/ci.yml inside your generated project:

yaml
Copier
Modifier
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pre-commit pytest
      - name: Run pre-commit
        run: pre-commit run --all-files
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
Example: Pre‑commit Hooks
Add a .pre-commit-config.yaml at the project root:
